## Questions
- What role does proximity play in the development and growth of advanced technologies?
- How does technology transfer contribute to the creation of new businesses and convert knowledge into market value?
- What are advanced industries and how do they differ from advanced technologies?
- What are the KPIs of technology transfer in the World and Catalonia?
- What policies are in place to facilitate technology transfer in Spain and what could we add to them to stimulate the growth of advanced industries?

## What I learned: 
- Data mining with Python and OSMNX.
- Data preprocessing, cleaning, enriching, formatting with Python Pandas and Geopandas.
- Developing isochrones with Python, QGIS and Grasshopper + Earth Engine.
- Data vizualisation with Grasshopper, Urbano and Decoding Spaces.
- Overlapping maps and merging datasets to generate processed maps.
- Identify patterns and insights via map-based anaysis.

## Key takeaways
- Advanced industries exhibit varied hierarchies and codes for economic activities across the EU, the USA, China, and Japan, reflecting the diverse regulatory and market landscapes in these regions.
- Advanced technologies refer to advanced tools, processes and methodologies that promote innovation, while advanced industries are those that make extensive use of these technologies to produce high value-added products and services, although not always directly related companies with advanced industries, using advanced technologies.
- Proximity plays a crucial role in the common growth of startup ecosystems; however, as they mature, they begin to compete and tend to become more estranged.
- The primary contenders in the R&D market are the USA and China, which have invested billions of dollars in public R&D funds in recent years, showcasing their commitment to leading innovation and technological advancement.
- Approximately 95% of global R&D expenditure is concentrated within three regions: North America, with the USA playing a pivotal role; the European Economic Area (EEA), where Germany, the UK, France, Italy, and the Benelux countries are key contributors; and East Asia, encompassing China, Korea, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, with China and Japan spearheading the development in the majority of advanced industries.
- In Spain, private investments in R&D account for 0.4% of the global total, while Catalonia alone contributes around 25% to the country's industrial-sourced GDP, highlighting its significant role in Spain's economic landscape and its potential as a hub for innovation and industrial development.
- Barcelona ranks between the 4th and 5th top startup hubs in Europe, increasingly aggregating startups that complement the advanced industries sector.
- The Government of Catalonia aims to reindustrialize the community by increasing the Gross Value Added (GVA) from 20% to 25% in 5 years, thanks to the stimulation of advanced industries.
- Several advanced industries, such as Pharmtech, Biotech, and Chemicaltech, lead the Catalan economy, while other globally demanded sectors like robotics, additive manufacturing, and electric vehicles are underrepresented in the Barcelona metropolitan region, and this policy-making rsearch is focused on stimulating these latter sectors.
- While traditional industries are typically located along main rail corridors, advanced industries can be dispersed throughout the entire metropolitan area.
- Policy-making effectively employs clustering as a tool for stimulating economic development, making geographically linked clusters the most potent instrument for the development of economic ecosystems.
- The real Barcelona agglomeration is woven from interconnected industrial and social clusters and is quite extensive compared to the limited metropolitan authorities.
